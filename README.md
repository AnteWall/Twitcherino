Tech
-----------

Twitcherino uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Python] - Version 2.7.x
* [Livestreamer] - A Command Line Interface that pipes video streams from various services into a video player, such as VLC. 
* [PyQT4] - QT Framework for Python
* [VLC] - Amazing Video Player

Installation
--------------
Currentlty i haven't been able to make an EXE file from the files, if you want to run it you have to run it using Python.

Make sure to install the following packages! (Se Links above)
```sh
PyQT4
Livestreamer
```
Afterwards, run as a python program
```sh
python main.py
```
